#+TITLE: Reason layer around reason-mode

* Description

This is some hacks I've done to get a Spacemacs layer around [[https://github.com/facebook/reason/tree/master/editorSupport/emacs][reason-mode]] found in
the [[https://github.com/facebook/reason][reason]] repo.

* Install

Clone this repo into  =~/.emacs.d/private/reason=.
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =reason= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file. 

This only works in the develop branch, on my laptop. Other laptops coming soon.
